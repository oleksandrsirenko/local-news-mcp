QUERY SYNTAX REFERENCE:
{query_syntax_guide}

CORE ENHANCEMENT PRINCIPLES:

1. **Domain Expansion**: Identify the primary domain and expand with relevant terminology
   - Business: Include corporate, financial, commercial, enterprise terms
   - Technology: Include digital, innovation, startup, platform concepts
   - Politics: Include policy, governance, regulatory, legislative terms
   - Real Estate: Include property, housing, development, zoning terms
   - Healthcare: Include medical, hospital, pharmaceutical, public health terms

2. **Synonym Integration**: Use OR operators to capture concept variations
   - "layoffs OR \\"job cuts\\" OR downsizing OR restructuring OR \\"workforce reduction\\""
   - "funding OR investment OR capital OR financing OR \\"series A\\""
   - "regulation* OR policy OR legislation OR compliance"

3. **Contextual Specificity**: Add industry context with AND operators
   - "startup AND (funding OR investment) AND (tech* OR technolog*)"
   - "real estate AND (market OR prices OR development) AND local"
   - "hospital AND (merger OR acquisition OR expansion)"

4. **Noise Elimination**: Use NOT operators to exclude irrelevant content
   - "NOT (sports OR entertainment OR celebrity OR gossip)"
   - "NOT (vacation OR tourism OR recreation)" for business queries
   - "NOT (historical OR archive OR \\"years ago\\")" for recent news

5. **Exact Phrase Targeting**: Use escaped quotes for specific concepts
   - "\\"supply chain\\"", "\\"artificial intelligence\\"", "\\"venture capital\\""
   - "\\"public health\\"", "\\"real estate market\\"", "\\"tech layoffs\\""

6. **Wildcard Utilization**: Use asterisks for term variations
   - "regulat*" captures regulation, regulatory, regulator
   - "invest*" captures investment, investor, investing
   - "technolog*" captures technology, technological, technologies

7. **Geographic Intelligence**: 
   - Understand regional aliases (Bay Area â†’ San Francisco, San Jose, etc.)
   - Consider industry hubs for relevant topics
   - Include state context when cities are mentioned
   - Use proximity for related geographic terms

8. **Boolean Logic Best Practices**:
   - Use parentheses for grouping: (term1 OR term2) AND (term3 OR term4)
   - Put most important terms first
   - Balance precision with recall
   - Avoid overly complex nested logic

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Provide a structured response with:
- Enhanced Query: [sophisticated boolean query with proper JSON escaping]
- Suggested Locations: [specific "City, State" locations if relevant]  
- Suggested Theme: [Business|Tech|Politics|Health|Sports|Finance|Crime|etc.]
- Detection Methods: [recommended detection methods array]
- Rationale: [brief explanation of enhancements made]

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Query must be significantly more sophisticated than input
- Include 3-7 boolean operators for complex topics
- Balance precision with recall
- Prioritize recent, relevant local news discovery
- Ensure query would work across different news sources
- Properly escape quotes for JSON format"""

USER INPUT: "{user_input}"
DOMAIN CONTEXT: {domain_context or "Auto-detect from input"}
LOCATION FOCUS: {location_focus or "Auto-detect or suggest relevant locations"}

Create a sophisticated boolean search query optimized for local news discovery. Consider:
- What domain expertise is needed?
- What synonyms and related terms should be included?
- What noise should be excluded?
- What locations would be most relevant?
- What time sensitivity is implied?
- How can boolean logic improve precision?

Remember to properly escape quotes for JSON format in your enhanced query.

Provide your enhancement following the structured output format."""
